# GifApp with React
How many times you want to find the perfect gif and you don't know a beauty page to do it? 
... Don't worry, here's the GifApp!

**Find different Gifs** about anything you want, just find it and there is!
The search is limit for 12 cards.

This project is a basic example about how **to consume an API** in React. I used GIPHY to do it, you can find it here:
